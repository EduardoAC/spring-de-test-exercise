Interview challenge fetching, merge and display data

## The challenge: "Fetch asynchronous data from an API".

Your task is to write a script or app which gathers data from two endpoints
asynchronously, merges the responses and displays them in any way in the browser.

For example you could use these two endpoints:

* http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1 to obtain a user's data
* http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1 to obtain all comments written by that user
